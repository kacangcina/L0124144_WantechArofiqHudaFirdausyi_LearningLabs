            <h1>MAKOTO YUKI</h1>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>A second-year who transferred to Gekkoukan High School in the spring, returning to the island he used to live on as a child.
                    After a run-in with a frightening monster awakens him to the power of Persona, he is recruited by the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES). 
                    The first Persona that awakens within him is Orpheus, but he turns out to be a special case who can swap between multiple Personas at will, giving the player 
                    great flexibility in battle strategy.</p>

                <h1>YUKARI TAKEBA</h1>

                <p>A second-year at Gekkoukan High School and a classmate of the Protagonist. Her cheerful personality and good looks attract many admirers, but beneath the pleasantries, she's rather headstrong and aloof. Sheâ€™s a member of SEES as a Persona-user, and after she and the Protagonist have a close call with a Shadow, she reconsiders her lack of battle experience and joins him on the front lines.
                    She utilizes her skills from the archery club to draw her bow in battle. Her unique Persona is Io, specializing in wind and healing skills.</p>

            <h1>JUNPEI IORI</h1>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Another of the Protagonist's classmates, next to Yukari. He awakens to his Persona abilities shortly after the Protagonist transfers into the school, prompting him to join the rest of SEES in the Iwatodai Dorm. Quite the class clown, he's always ready to joke around and lighten the mood... which isn't always appreciated by the eye-rolling Yukari.
                    In battle, he uses a two-handed sword along with his unique Persona, Hermes. He specializes in physical and fire skills.</p>

                <h1>AIGIS</h1>

                <p>A man-made Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapon, 7th Generation. She joins SEES as an android with a humanlike heart, granting her the power of Persona.
                    She harbors a mysterious attachment to the Protagonist from the first day they meet. Initially coming across as cold and robotic, she begins to discover more human emotions through her experiences with the group.
                    In battle, she fires off an arsenal of weapons built into her mechanical body. Her unique Persona is Palladion, specializing in physical and support skills.</p>
